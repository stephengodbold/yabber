#Yabber

An opportunity to play with NodeJS, Angular and whatever else I felt like along the way. 

##The Plan 

The site is intended to:
 * list a set of talks
 * indicate a currently active talk
 * live stream the talk

##Are you mad? Have you done this before?!


No. This would be the first time I've played with any of this stuff. Judge away. It's a half a day's hacking so far :)
